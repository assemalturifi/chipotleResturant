# chipotleResturant
Created an application that simulates Chipotle restaurant to help manage their process of selling their rice bowls. There is base bowl 
with a base price, and can be added up to four additional priced items like lettuce or tomato etc. Also, there is a healthy bowl and it 
can be added two additional priced items. Lastly, there is special menu that customers cant add anything and there is a solid price.
The program uses object streams, inheritance and has three classes and a main class.
